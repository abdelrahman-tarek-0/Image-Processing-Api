# Image Processing API
hi

this is Image Processing API  for udacity nanodegree

this project takes an image and resizes it for width and height between (0 and 3000) pixel

I used in this project typescript language and testing with jasmine and supertest for 
code without errors

and I also used eslint and prettier for clean good looking code


## Scripts

```bash
npm run start
```
for compiling the ts into js

```bash
npm run build
```
for test with jasmin and supertest
```bash
npm run test
```
for using eslint and prettier
```bash
npm run clean
```

## url

```
